# Data-type-Function Programming
This repository record the basic concept of Data-type-Function Programming
And it's so sad that I can't use Latex in github.
If you find there's some messy code, try to download the .md file and open it with you markdown editor.
I will only upload .pdf file afterwards in case of messing.
# Basic
The intuition of Data-type-Function Programming comes from math function, look, there's a function below
$$
f(x)
$$
it has two part $f()$ and $x$, actually in math $f()$ is function but in code language like C the function should be $f(x)$, because when we define a function we also have to claim the type of $x$, so the function can't be separated from the data type.<!--so you have to write different functions for different types.-->

Now considering making a difference. First let review some math <!--knowledge-->.

Starting with the most simple function +, and we will use $sum$ to express it which will make it look like a function in your code. For the real number $x$, we can simply see sum is just
$$
sum(x_1,x_2)=x_1+x_2
$$
this sounds stupid because itâ€˜s very clearly, but let consider $x$ to be a $2\times1$ matrix, so
$$
sum(x_1,x_2)=
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
a_1\\
b_1
\end{array}
\right)
+
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
a_2\\
b_2
\end{array}
\right)
=
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
a_1+a_2\\
b_1+b_2
\end{array}
\right)
$$
That looks like different, but ponder for a while you will find the structure of sum is not changed, that maybe hard to understand, but I just want to show you a abstract function can take different forms for different variables, or data type in programming.

So there's an addition for real number and another for matrix, but we all call it addition because there have the same structure, or in math we say the obey the same rule. And it explicit form is only determined by data type.

So now if we want to design a coding language similar to this, Using compare function for example which is different for real number and complex number, try

```
define compare(x_1,x_2)

struct real{
com
}
```



```
define sum(u1,u2) #here we define a abstract function

struct real
{
addition:
x_new = x1 +x2
}

struct matrix
{
addition:
a_new = a1 + a2
b_new = b1 + b2
}
#This is not a standard code, I only use it to express the different addition is defined in different data type
```

Above we define the explicit addition operator for real & matrix in their data type, so when you use $sum(x_1,x_2)$ it will look for the addition operation in the data type, then use it  to make a sum.

Now we can see the function is separated from the data type, $sum$ only means sum, how to make a sum, you should refer to the addition in the data type. And the biggest difficulty I find is to explain what is the difference between it and object-oriented programming, and now I will give it a try. To see the difference, we need the function to be more complex.

```
define arrange(x1,x2,x3)
{
if x1>x2 then swith(x1,x2)
if x3>x2 then swith(x2,x3)
}
# This is a function will arrange it x1,x2,x3 according to its size
# Notice there is two 
```



### Advantage

1. easy to read, especially for algorithm code

   Because our function is separated from data type, you don't need to care data type when you are coding functions, this makes the function easy to write and read, or in other words, because we don't write any thing related to data type, your function would be far more short, thus easy to read. The code of this type of programming should be concise as math equations. 

2. Easy for syntax check

   Your operators are defined in your data struct, they will also tell functions which type can be operated with them. Below is an example, you define an addition operator in your struct, and the data type that can be add with them. If you try $sum(x1,x2)$ and $x1$ is a real number, $x2$ is a matrix, the checker will tell you they can not be add because the addition.object in real don't have 'matrix'.

   ```
   struct real
   {
   addition:
   	{object : 'real' 'integer'}
   	{procedure:
   		x1 + x2
   	}
   }
   
   function sum(x1,x2){
   	addition(x1,x2)
   }
   ```

   And it's easy to check all the operators used in your function.

3. Convenient to share

4. Fast operation speed

5. Easy for Parallel Processing 

You may have use this idea in your code, but have you generated it every structure in your code?
